## What does Freedeck do?
Freedeck is only limited by your imagination.
Currently, Freedeck supports *3* actionable tile types natively:
- Soundboard (play any sound through an output device, like [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
- App Volume (control any Windows application's volume)
- Macro (type or press any key combo on Windows)

However, Freedeck is *not* limited to this.
