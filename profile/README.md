## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Freedeck.
Freedeck is an open-source alternative to the Stream Deck that replaces any device of yours with a personalizable macro pad!

[Check out our website! \(freedeck.app\)](https://freedeck.app)

## Freedeck v6 is HERE!

Freedeck v6 is a full rewrite of the Freedeck system. It comes with many features that are great for usability:
- an extensible plugin system & Marketplace 
- an extensible button editor (Freedeck Studio)
- optimized JS bundles with Webpack
- easily extendable settings menu/api
- and so much more!

## What does a Freedeck do?
Freedeck is only limited by your imagination.

Your computer will host a server on port 5754 (configurable), and you'll need to go to {LocalIP}:5754 on any web browser/device to start using it.
Companion **will** launch alongside the Freedeck Host. 
Companion is the desktop configuration tool. 

## It looks bad
**Freedeck is best viewed in landscape mode.**

## It looks bad on my device
[IOS] Add it to your homescreen from the Share sheet.  
[Any other device] From a menu where you can add the app as a PWA to your home screen, add it. This may be a share button, or a standalone Install button.

## It still looks bad
Not sure what to tell ya. Try theming it with Companion!
