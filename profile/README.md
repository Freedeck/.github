## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Freedeck.
Susdeck (Being renamed to Freedeck) is an open-source alternative to the Stream Deck that replaces any device of yours with a personal macro pad!

## What does a Susdeck do?
Susdeck presses keys on your keyboard like a Stream Deck. 

Your computer will host a server on port 5754 (configurable), and you'll need to go to {LocalIP}:5754 on any web browser/device to start using it.

Companion **will** launch alongside the Susdeck server. 

Companion is the desktop configuration tool. 

You'll use Companion for everything modifying your Susdeck.

## It looks bad
**Susdeck is best viewed in landscape mode.**

Not sure what to tell ya.
